Exercise 1. Exploiting Techniques.

We have learned the two techniques:
- exploiting Function return address in a classical way;
- using return-to-libc.

But there are many other options.

Option 1.1 Find on Internet a working example of forcing the software to run malicious code by using either of the techniques below:
- using SEH (SaveSEH or SEHOR) at Windows;
- forcing the software to jump to the malicious code;
- forcing the software to slide to the malicious code;
- overwrite a Global Offset Table;
- overwrite GCC created destructors (.dtors);
- virtual table attackes (vptr);
- hijacking atexit();
- longjump() based exploits.
- etc. options on your choice.

Find on Internet a working at Win-7 and up (32-bit or 64-bit) or at modern gcc/kernel as Ubuntu 14 and up (32-bit or 64-bit) example.
Check that the example is still working indeed with restrictions stated there.
Write a small paper containing the link and details on the steps to reproduce.
Be prepared to demostrate it in the class and explain all the steps and the technique. 


Option 1.2 Improve the basic intrusion example based on:
http://crypto.Stanford.edu/~blynn/rop/

Check that it is working indeed.
Write a small paper containing the link and details on the steps to reproduce.
Be prepared to demostrate it in the class and explain all the steps. 



Exercise 2. Reverse Engineering.

Option 2.1
Using IDA tool modify Ghotit-Real-Writer-and-Reader.exe
Be prepared to step-by-step demonstration of the analyses and cut and explain your modification and techniques used in the classroom.

Option 2.2
Explain options or techniques available in IDA but not teached in the classroom.
